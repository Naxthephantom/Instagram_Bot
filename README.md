# Instagram_Bot
An instagram bot is an automated bot that helps instergram users reach a greater audience, therefore helping them 
gain more followers and likes in the process, all while hardly lifting a finger.

For this project i'll be using 'instaPy' which is a library which automates your instagram activities so that you gain
more followers and likes with minimal manual input.

HOW INSTAGRAM BOTS WORK
 How can an automation script gain you more followers and likes?
Well, think about how an actual person would gain followers and likes, by being active and consistent on the platform, posting often,
following other people and interacting with other peoples posts and contents.
 All these have to be on a consistent basis based on the criteria you set for your machine to follow.

The more specific and detailed the criteria you set is, the better your result will be.
 The details are important because the people your bot interacts with on instagram, are most likely the same set or kind of people that will interact with your content.

 To give a rough break down of how the bot will function:
1. you serve it your cridentials (your logins)
2. you set the criteria for who to follow, what comments to leave and which type of posts to like
3. your bot will open a browser, open the instagrem wb site, log in with the cridencials you have provided and start carrying out the instructions you have given it.
